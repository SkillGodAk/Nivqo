/**
 * Hosts a run in a process of its own declared for it, in the JVM the app embeds or on the ART of
 * the process. When the system runs short of memory for a large run, or the heap of the run fills
 * up, it is this process that ends, and the app is left to report it.
 *
 * Bound by [PatcherProcesses] for a single run. The host is started first and waits for the run,
 * so it can be started before the run is known. The process ends with the run, which is also the
 * only way to stop a JVM, and the next run starts in a fresh one.
