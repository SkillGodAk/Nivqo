/**
 * Shows Facebook's tabs, its Menu and the screens that open over it without the slide between
 * them. Each moves its own way. A screen that opens over the app, like the post composer, is its
 * own activity: the settings patch already watches every Facebook screen from the application's
 * onCreate, and from those callbacks the extension's ScreenTransitions asks Android for no
 * transition once this patch says it's in the build. A tab and the Menu are Facebook's own view
 * animations, and for those the patch asks the extension where Facebook decides to slide
 * (TransitionAnchors.kt). A tab strip inside a screen asks its pager for the page, and the patch
 * asks the extension first in the two places a tap goes through (PagerTabs.kt). A photo zooms from
 * its place in the feed on a spring, and the patch asks the extension as the spring is set going
 * (PhotoZoom.kt), and a multi-photo post's photo opens on a page whose zoom, fade and slides run
 * for a length the patch has go through the extension (PhotoPage.kt). A screen opened inside
 * Facebook's own, like a post's page, is a fragment that
 * slides in and out with the animations its transaction is handed, and the patch has each go
 * through the extension as it's handed over (FragmentSlides.kt).
 *
 * In the default selection with its switch off: Facebook's transitions are a matter of taste, not
 * something it does to you.
