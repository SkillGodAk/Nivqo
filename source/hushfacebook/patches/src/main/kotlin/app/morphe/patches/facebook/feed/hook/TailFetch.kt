/*
 * Why Home could stop loading with most of it hidden (read from 582, 2026-10-14).
 *
 * Home's scroll fetcher, NewsFeedListViewScrollFetcher, runs onScroll on every scroll of the list.
 * It asks the feed loader for the next page (loadAfterData, "tailFetchListener") only when the post
 * on screen has moved past the one it last asked at. The feed guard turns edges away in
 * addNewEdgeToCollection, and when it turns away most or all of a page, nothing new reaches the
 * list: the post on screen stays where it was, the fetcher never asks again, and Home sits on its
 * loading row however far it's scrolled. A heap dump at such a stall showed the feed collection and
 * the list holding the same two edges, onScroll still running on every swipe, and its log state
 * reading shouldFetch=false, atTail=true.
 *
 * So onScroll's branch that doesn't fetch asks the extension first, with the last row on screen and
 * the number of rows, and goes to the ask Facebook would have made when told to. The ask is the
 * block that logs "dispatchTailFetch"; its "isTailVisible" value reads those same two fields off the
 * fetcher, and the code here reads them the same way.
