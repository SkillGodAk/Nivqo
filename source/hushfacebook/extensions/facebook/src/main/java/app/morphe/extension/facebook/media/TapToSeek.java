/**
 * Tap the bar to seek (#125): a tap anywhere on a reel's or video's progress bar jumps there.
 *
 * <p>Facebook's bar (582 {@code LX/9A0}) runs one of two ways, and a server setting picks which
 * per account. Thumb-only turns away a press that misses the thumb. Drag-anywhere hands every
 * touch to Android's SeekBar, but a tap there still doesn't move the video, since Facebook passes
 * it on to the video as a tap. A drag that starts on the thumb seeks either way, so that's what a
 * tap becomes here.
 *
 * <p>The patch asks {@link #takesTouch} first in the bar's touch handler. A press that misses the
 * thumb is held. If it lifts without moving, Facebook's handler is played a drag from the thumb to
 * that spot. If it moves sideways, the handler gets a press on the thumb and then the real moves,
 * so the thumb follows the finger. A vertical swipe is left alone: the reel pager takes it from
 * the bar as it always did. A press on the thumb, a bar that's off or has no length yet, or the
 * switch off, paused or not ready all leave every touch to Facebook.
