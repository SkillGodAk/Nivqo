/**
 * The ring between the overlapping reaction icons at the bottom right of a post (issue #147).
 *
 * <p>Facebook's FDSInlineReactions draws the icons as one drawable and separates each from the one
 * it overlaps in one of two ways, decided by the colour its style hands it. A colour with any
 * transparency makes it cut a ring out of the icon behind, so the page shows through; an opaque one
 * makes it paint a disc of that colour behind the next icon. The bling bar's COLOR and MEDIA styles
 * hand it ALWAYS_TRANSPARENT and get the cut. The SURFACE style hands it SURFACE_BACKGROUND, resolved
 * on the row's context, which in Facebook's dark styles is its #252728 surface and in the light ones
 * white. One reporter on a black AMOLED page saw white discs behind the icons: that resolve came back
 * light. A ring painted in any one colour can only match one page, while the cut matches every page,
 * AMOLED's black, a picked background colour and Material You's tint alike.
 *
 * <p>So in dark mode, with AMOLED or Material You in the build, an opaque ring colour comes back fully
 * transparent and the drawable cuts the ring instead. A colour that's already translucent, light
 * mode, and a build with neither theme come back as they were. The reactions token pile, a second
 * facepile that paints discs by default, gets the page colour through {@link #pile} instead.
