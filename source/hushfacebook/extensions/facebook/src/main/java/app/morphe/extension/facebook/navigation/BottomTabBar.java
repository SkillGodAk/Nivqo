/**
 * Where the tab bar goes. Facebook puts it at the top for some accounts and at the bottom for
 * others, by a server setting, and keeps a preference of its own that overrides that setting
 * either way: fb4a_bottom_tabs_override_enabled, a TriState its own tab menu can write. Each place
 * that decides where the bar goes reads that preference and branches on the TriState's ordinal, YES
 * for the bottom and NO for the top, with UNSET leaving it to the server. The hook goes right after
 * each of those reads, and the answer is YES's ordinal while the bottom switch is on, NO's while the
 * top one is.
 *
 * <p>Off, paused, before the settings are ready, or when anything here fails, the answer is
 * Facebook's own. Facebook places the bar as its main screen starts, so a change shows after a
 * restart.
